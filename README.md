# Euclidea
This project is for me & my experiments with 3D Graphics. Source code available
for the curious.

## Running
The program can be run from the root directory if you have a Common Lisp
installation with asdf & quicklisp. Further, you'll need to make sure that the
dynamic library for glfw3 is available.

Then, tlone this repository & make sure that asdf can see the repo. To run:

```lisp
(ql:quickload :euclidea)
(main)
```

## Non-Features
This is not intended to be a 'useful' game/program, merely an experiment/demo.
Feel free to build on the program/take inspiration from what I've done here.
Happy coding :)
